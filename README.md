This project allows you to convert images into block-based representations for use in the game **Growtopia**. It replaces each section of the original image with the closest matching Growtopia block, resulting in an image composed of tiles.

## Features

- Converts images into Growtopia tile/block grids.
- Automatically resizes images to fit within the 99x53 tile grid size limit.
- Color matching algorithm to find the closest Growtopia block for each section.
- Supports multiple block types for more accurate representations.
